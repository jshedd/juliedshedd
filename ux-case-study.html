								<li>To learn more about the users of the MSU Libraries website</li>

                            <p>Three usability tests - a card-sorting activity, a participatory design activity, and a contextual task analysis) were performed, with visitors to the Mitchell Memorial Library serving as study subjects. Subjects were recruited as they entered the Library and offered an incentive (a snack or drink) in return for their participation. Participants in each task were given a brief survey to collect some basic demographics and information about their use of the Libraries website. Results were reported to the MSU Libraries' Web Services Department, Assessment Committee, and Library Technologies Committee, and published on a website detailing the Libraries' self-assessment activities.</p>

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Card Sorting Task</div>
                            <p>A table was set with large cards labeled "Research," "Services," "About," "Need Help?," and "Other." 3x5" index cards were numbered and labeled with page titles from the MSU Libraries website. Participants were asked to examine these labels and sort them into the five main categories, arranging them in order of importance. Participants were also invited to create their own categories and sort the cards again.</p>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Participatory Design Task</div>
							<p>Images of visual elements of the Libraries homepage were printed onto cardstock. Participants were asked to physically arrange these against a background to construct their ideal MSU Libraries' homepage, thinking out loud as they worked.</p>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Contextual Task Analysis</div>
							<p>A table was set with laptops and cameras. Participants were asked to perform three tasks on the Libraries homepage, thinking out loud as they worked. During this task, careful notes were taken, and participants' actions and facial expressions were recorded. Participants were then asked to complete a survey to indicate their feelings about the tasks, including how easy it was to find items, how intuitive the links were, and whether they found useful information. Feelings were assessed using a modified version of the System Usability Scale.</p>

                            <h3 class="mb-0">Findings</h3>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Card Sort Task</div>
                            <p>Findings suggested that our terminology and content infrastructure did not align with users' understanding of what most terms meant. Only a few terms were very strongly associated with a specific category. Most others were not understood by users to mean what library faculty and staff meant. For instance, users often placed "Organizational Chart" under the "Research" category, and terms referring to library research materials or collections as "Services" (e.g., "Online Catalog," "Special Collections"). </p>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Participatory Design Task</div>
                            <p>Participants saw the website's header as an area devoid of most content, apart from advertisements. Several expressed a wish for a "thinner" header and footer so that they could fit more into the central "content" area. Elements including social media links and share buttons, news articles, and ads for Libraries services, collections, and events were frequently left off.</p>
                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Contextual Task Analysis</div>
                            <p>Most participants reported feeling confident that they could use the website without needing much guidance, and would do so frequently. However, they did feel that the site was unnecessarily complex. The data collected reflected the second sentiment far more than the first. Several participants quit tasks if the solution was not immediately apparent. Several displayed confusion about the difference between types of library materials (Online Catalog, research databases, e-journals). One participant even had to be told that they were in fact using the Libraries website at that moment - they never used it before, because the text was too small for them to read.</p>

                    </div>
					<div class="d-flex flex-column flex-md-row justify-content-between mb-5">
                        <div class="flex-grow-1">
                            <h3 class="mb-0">Results</h3>
                            <p>The data collected via all three activities suggested that:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The Libraries' website relied heavily on "librarianese" - a vocabulary used between trained librarians that other users tended to misunderstand</li>
								<li>Users visited the website primarily to find research materials, or to discover when they would be able to visit - they were less interested in sharing the site with friends, or in library events</li>
								<li>Many routine research tasks were needlessly complicated - some users took surprising routes to reach a destination</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Based on the findings, the Web Services Department created a new, flatter, simpler content infrastructure; a more streamlined user interface; and more lay-friendly language for website content. They also created a new full-time position (User Experience Specialist) so that the Libraries could continue to benefit from regular user testing and a Design Thinking-informed perspective on web design. Finally, they were able to make recommendations to the entirety of the MSU Libraries about what kind of language to use when communicating with library users.</p>
